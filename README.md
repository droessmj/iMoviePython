iMovie Python Fix

This project is for the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire LTS Department to help the training staff deal 
with importing and exporting iMovie projects on network locations.

The code is 100% Python, and it was as much a learning experience for myself as it was a contribution to the 
university.
